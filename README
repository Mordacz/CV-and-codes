My current CV is available in CV_Orda_Mateusz.pdf

Some examples of my codes form last year are in following directories:

databases project (Python + SQL):
Small (individual) project for university subject about databases.

We were given the concrete specification. Shortly: we have the database with information about cities and airports; we are allowed to do some preprocessing, like adding new tables, and should then process events about flights (interaction uses some API). I translated into English README file (with more concrete documentation) and comments in init.sql.


reversi (C++):
Task for university subject about artificial intelligence.

It contains smart bot playing reversi (a board game) against agent using random strategy. The task was to achieve average win ratio like 98% in 200 games, with some time limit (a few minutes).

My bot uses precalculated data (which stand for heuristic 'value' of each field after some turns) and Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm, which develops a tree during consecutive games (so initially the tree is poor, but it becomes better and better in further plays).


data structures (C++):

I really like competitive programming. I've been doing it for a long time (started in 2013), since few years also teaching algorithms and data structures (preparing high school students to Polish Olympiad in Informatics). 

Here I picked two non-trivial data structures (segment tree with lazy propagation and treap). I implemented them step by step during classes (presented coding process using screen sharing and live discussion about what happens there).
